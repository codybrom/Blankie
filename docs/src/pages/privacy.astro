          I maintain this privacy policy not just because it's required to be
          part of Apple's ecosystem but because I strongly believe in
          transparency. To put it plainly, your information never leaves your
          computer. The Blankie app doesn't connect to the internet, collect
          analytics, or track you in any way. When you use a version of Blankie
          distributed through Apple's platforms, Apple may provides us with some
          basic anonymous statistics about downloads and crashes, but the app
          itself (whether from GitHub, Homebrew or the App Store) never collects
          or transmits any data directly back to Blankie's developers. The
          formal policy below explains this in more detail, but that's really
          all there is to it. â€”@codybrom

      <strong>Effective Date</strong>: May 15, 2025
    </p>

    <p class="text-mid-gray mb-4">
      Your privacy is important to us. The Blankie app does not collect, store,
      or share any personal information and there are no tracking or analytics
      frameworks implemented in the app as part of the source code.
    </p>

    <p class="text-mid-gray mb-4">
      When you get Blankie through the Mac App Store or join our public
      TestFlight beta, Apple may collect some usage data (as explained in their
      privacy policy). Apple never shares your identifiable personal information
      with us. We (the developers of Blankie) do not have anything that
      identifies you unless you explicitly share it.
    </p>

    <p class="text-mid-gray mb-4">
      On a limited basis, trusted contributors may be granted access to
      internal-only TestFlight betas. For these private betas, we need to share
      an email address with Apple to facilitate an invitation. If necessary, the
      collection of this email address is only used for the TestFlight
      invitation process and is not shared with anyone else.
    </p>

    <p class="text-mid-gray mb-4">
      Apple shares basic anonymous statistics with developers about how many
      people downloaded the app, the store region they downloaded it from and if
      it crashes. We use this information to make Blankie more stable and
      reliable. You can learn more about Apple's data collection practices in

    </p>

    <p class="text-mid-gray mb-4">
      This privacy policy applies only to the Blankie app and its website. It
      does not apply to any third-party services or websites that may be linked
      to from the app or website.
    </p>

    <p class="text-mid-gray mb-4">
      By using the Blankie app or website, you agree to the terms of this
      policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the app or
      website.
    </p>

    <p class="text-mid-gray mb-4">
      The Mac App Store, blankie.rest (this website), Homebrew, GitHub and
      TestFlight are all considered official distribution channels of Blankie.
      If you download the app from any other source, the makers of Blankie
      cannot guarantee that it is safe or secure. We recommend only downloading
      the app from the official channels listed above. Blankie is open source
      and you can always build it from source if you want to verify the code
      yourself. If you do this, you are responsible for your own privacy and
      security.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Data Collection</h2>
    <ul class="text-mid-gray list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
      <li>
        <strong>Information You Provide</strong>: If you contribute code or
        translations to the Blankie project and share your name or email address
        with us, we may use them to either credit or contact you. You do not
        need to share your name or email address with us to contribute to the
        project (communicating publicly via GitHub issues and discussions is
        actually our preference) and we will never sell your information or use
        it for any other purpose.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No Data Collection in App</strong>: The Blankie app never asks
        for, or stores any personal data such as names, emails, or physical
        addresses. This is true whether you download the app from the Blankie
        website, from GitHub, from Homebrew or from an Apple platform. The
        official version of Blankie never collects or transmits any data back to
        the developers and any usage statistics we receive come solely from
        Apple's platform services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No Analytics or Trackers</strong>: The official version of
        Blankie does not use any third-party services, advertising networks,
        analytics frameworks, libraries, SDKs, or APIs that collect personal
        data. Blankie does not include any analytics frameworks or trackers in
        the app or on this website.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Third Parties</strong>: Platform providers like Apple, GitHub,
        and Homebrew may collect some anonymous usage data when you use their
        platforms and services to interact with the Blankie project or download
        Blankie. The data you share with these platforms may or may not be
        shared with us, and in most cases we do not have access to it or control
        over how these platforms may use your data. We recommend you review the
        privacy policies of these platforms to understand how they handle your
        data.

      Since we do not collect any data, we cannot share anything with any third

      their data collection practices.

      While Blankie will always remain privacy-focused, Apple's developer

      Our commitment to privacy won't change.
