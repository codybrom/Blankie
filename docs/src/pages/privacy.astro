        <b>Note:</b> We maintain this privacy policy because we believe in
        transparency and because it's required to be part of Apple's ecosystem.
        To put it plainly, your information never leaves your computer. The
        Blankie app doesn't connect to the internet, collect analytics, or track
        you in any way. When distributed through Apple's platforms, Apple
        provides us with basic anonymous statistics about downloads and crashes,
        but the app binary itself (whether from GitHub or the App Store) never
        collects or transmits any data directly back to the developers. The
        formal policy below explains this in more detail, but that's really all
        there is to it. Your Blankie belongs to you.

      <strong>Effective Date</strong>: January 7, 2025
    </p>

    <p class="text-skin-muted mb-4">
      Your privacy is important to us. Blankie itself does not collect, store,
      or share any personal information and there are no tracking or analytics
      frameworks implemented in the app as part of the source code.
    </p>

    <p class="text-skin-muted mb-4">
      When you get Blankie through the Mac App Store or join our public
      TestFlight beta, Apple may collect some usage data (as explained in their
      privacy policy). Apple never shares your personal information with us
      unless you explicitly give it to us.
    </p>

    <p class="text-skin-muted mb-4">
      From time to time, some contributors may be granted access to private
      internal TestFlight betas. For these private betas, we need to share your
      email address with Apple so they can send you an invitation. This email
      address is only used for the TestFlight invitation process and is not
      shared with anyone else.
    </p>

    <p class="text-skin-muted mb-4">
      Apple also shares with us basic anonymous statistics about how many people
      downloaded the app and if it crashes. We use this information to make
      Blankie more stable and reliable. You can learn more about Apple's data
      collection in their

        <strong>No Data Collection in App</strong>: The Blankie binary, whether

      Data Sharing and Disclosure
    </h2>
    <p class="text-skin-muted mb-4">
      Since we do not collect any data, we cannot share anything with any third
      party. However, if you download through Apple's platforms, please refer to
      Apple's privacy policy regarding their data collection practices.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Updates</h2>
    <p class="text-skin-muted mb-4">
      While Blankie will always remain privacy-focused, Apple's requirements and
      other legal standards may evolve. If we need to update this policy to
      reflect such changes, you'll find the latest version here. Our commitment
      to privacy won't change.
