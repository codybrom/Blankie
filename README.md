### Current Priority Areas for Contribution

We're currenly looking for help with:

- [Adding custom sound support](https://github.com/codybrom/blankie/issues/1)
- [Translating Blankie into other languages](https://github.com/codybrom/blankie/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#translation-contributions)

## Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.**

2. **Copy `Configuration.example.xcconfig` to `Configuration.xcconfig`.**
    - Configuration.xcconfig is ignored by git to keep Bundle IDs and Team IDs private. Do not commit this file publicly to protect your work from impersonation, account misuse, and distribution conflicts.

3. **Add your development team to `Configuration.xcconfig`.**

      ```plaintext
      DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = YOUR_TEAM_ID_HERE
      ```

    - **Apple Developer Program Members:**
        - Retrieve your **Team ID**:
            1. Open Xcode and go to **Xcode > Preferences > Accounts**.
            2. Sign in with your Apple ID if you haven’t already.
            3. Select your account, click **Manage Certificates** or **View Details**, and find your **Team ID** under your account name.
        - Add your Team ID to `Configuration.xcconfig`:

    - **If You Are Not a Member of the Apple Developer Program:**
        - You can still test the app on your devices for free by creating an Xcode **Personal Team**. Follow these steps:
            1. Open Xcode and go to **Xcode > Preferences > Accounts**.
            2. Click the "+" button to add your Apple ID (if not already added).
            3. After signing in, Xcode will automatically create a **Personal Team** associated with your Apple ID.
            4. Go to **Xcode > Preferences > Accounts**, select your account, and click **View Details**. The Team ID for your Personal Team will be listed.
        - Use the Team ID from your Personal Team in `Configuration.xcconfig`:

4. **Set the Bundle Identifier:**

      ```plaintext
      PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = com.yournamehere.blankie
      ```

    - In `Configuration.xcconfig`, set `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` to a unique identifier. You can use any reverse domain name format for the bundle identifier, but it must be unique. You **cannot** use the same bundle identifier as the main Blankie app.

5. **Open `Blankie.xcodeproj` in Xcode**

6. **Build and run the project!**
