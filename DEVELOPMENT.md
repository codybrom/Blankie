# Development Setup

This guide will help you set up your development environment for contributing to Blankie.

## Prerequisites

- macOS 14.6 or later
- Xcode 16 or later
- An Apple Developer account (free or paid)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/blankie.git
   cd blankie
   ```

2. **Configure your development environment**

   Copy the example configuration file:

   ```bash
   cp Configuration.example.xcconfig Configuration.xcconfig
   ```

   > **Important**: `Configuration.xcconfig` is ignored by git to keep Bundle IDs and Team IDs private. Never commit this file.

3. **Add your development team**

   Edit `Configuration.xcconfig` and add your Team ID:

   ```plaintext
   DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = YOUR_TEAM_ID_HERE
   ```

   **Finding your Team ID:**

   - **Apple Developer Program Members:**
     1. Open Xcode → Preferences → Accounts
     2. Sign in with your Apple ID
     3. Select your account and click "Manage Certificates"
     4. Your Team ID is listed under your account name

   - **Personal Team (Free):**
     1. Open Xcode → Preferences → Accounts
     2. Click "+" to add your Apple ID
     3. Xcode will create a Personal Team automatically
     4. Your Personal Team ID will be listed there

4. **Set a unique Bundle Identifier**

   In `Configuration.xcconfig`, set a unique identifier:

   ```plaintext
   PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = com.yournamehere.blankie
   ```

   > **Note**: You cannot use the same bundle identifier as the official Blankie app.

5. **Open and build the project**

   ```bash
   open Blankie.xcodeproj
   ```

   Then build and run using Xcode (⌘+R).

## Code Style

- We *try* to follow the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
- Use `swift-format` with default settings
  - In Xcode: Editor → Structure → Format File with 'swift-format'
  - Or use the command line tool
- Match existing code patterns and conventions
- Write clear commit messages explaining your changes

## Testing

- Run existing unit tests: ⌘+U in Xcode
- Add tests for new functionality when possible
- Test your changes thoroughly before submitting a PR

## Important Considerations

> **⚠️ Exercise extreme caution when modifying:**
>
> - Sound configurations
> - Naming conventions
> - Preset functionality
>
> These directly affect user settings and even small changes can significantly impact the user experience.
